 A simple cypress test suite for a web app that accepts a number and returns the median of the prime numbers between 1 and the number entered

### Example

a) If n = 10, the set of prime numbers less than 10 is [2,3,5,7], and so the medians are [3,5]

b) If n = 18, the set of prime numbers less than 18 is [2,3,5,7,11,13,17], and so the median is [7]

## Running the application
node.js must be installed. Run `npm install` from the main folder of this project. Start the node server ('node server.js') and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to run the app.

### Running The App
